<p>Another benefit of never being sure which Bible verse is going to appear is the random generator gives you the opportunity to read Bible verses you may have forgotten or not thought thoroughly about. While you likely have your favorite parts of the Bible, having Bible verses appear at random can help you find appreciation for other parts of the Bible you don't spend as much time reading. This can be a wonderful way to expand your love of the Bible.</p>
